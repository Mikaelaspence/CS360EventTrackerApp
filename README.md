1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

EventTrack is a simple event management tool designed to help users stay organized and keep track of important events.  
EventTrack makes it easy to add, update, and manage your events. With a clean interface and easy navigation, EventTrack 
ensures you never miss an important date. The app also allows you to receive SMS notifications for your events, 
keeping you informed even when you're on the go.

2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs 
keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

There were several screens needed for this app. The first screen is the login/register screen. If a user needs to register, a new screen
to do so pops up. Once registered and logged in, The event display shows any events already inputted. There is an option to add events.
When an event is added, a screen pops up asking if the user wants SMS notifications enabled with yes or no options. 
If you click on a displayed event, a window pops up allowing users to update or delete the event info. User inteface is a simple
design and the color scheme/theme are consistent throughout the various screens. 

3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or
    strategies be applied in the future?

To approach the coding portion of the app I used the various resources and reading material provided. I went through some of the 
ZYBooks sample appolications we had done previousy and followed some of those examples tweaked to the event tracker purpose instead,
such as creating a database, CRUD functionality and displaying a grid. These could certainly be applied various types of projects
in the future, since database management and CRUD functionality are very commonly used. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I ran the code very frequently to make sure it was functional. I came across a few problems. Once I added the CRUD functionality
my login screen kept crashing when I tried to log in. I had to go use the LogCat information to figure out where things went awry
and go back to fix it. I also initially messed up the way the events were updated because I did not assign them an individual ID,
so it would just update the first entry no matter which you were trying to update so I had to fix that. Running it over and over,
testing that invalid log ins did not work, testing that valid ones did work, ensuring SMS notifications were able to be enabled or disabled by the user,
checking the correct event is deleted if deleting, updated if updating, and that events were added appropriately were all things 
I looked for in testing. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to 
overcome a challenge?

I did not have to do a ton of innovating to finish this project. I followed the tutorials and given information. My app ended up
being very simplistic. I did a lot of running and testing as listed above, however, and fixed probelms as I ran into them as 
mentioned in the previous question.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, 
and experience?

Honestly, I was just happy I got it tp run and perform all of the required functionality. It took me a long time to adjust to 
Android Studio as I had not used it ever before. Learning the interface, switching between display mode and the actual code,
even finding the run button were all things that took me a little more time than expected. However, I am very happy with how it
works and have gained much more comfort working with Android Studio and developing an app.
